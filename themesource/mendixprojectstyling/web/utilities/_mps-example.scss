/// Utilities are used to make small changes to widgets. The main drawback of
/// utilities in Studio Pro is that it's only possible to add a class to the
/// most outer element in HTML. However in Mendix a lot of widgets have multiple
/// layers of HTML to create a single widget.
/// Nevertheless utilities can be very useful to change sizing, position, color
/// and more.
/// Utilities only change a single css property. This is to make sure they are
/// as reusable as possible. PDS has many utilities to choose from so make sure
/// to check them out before creating a new one.
/// All PDS components and utilities are prepended with `pds-`. All your classes
/// will be prepended with `mps-`. This is done to mark them as something you
/// wrote yourself. This is because Mendix has many places where CSS can come
/// from like widgets and other modules.
/// Utilities other than components to not use BEM.
/// All files are also encapsulated with `#mxapp {}` to make sure your styling
/// takes precendence over other styling.
/// It's also important to load the file in _mps.scss after you have created it.
/// When possible use the constants, functions and mixins in PDS. They can be
/// found in `platformdesignsystem/web/[constants/functions/mixins]`

/// @example #mxapp {
///            .mps-color {
///              &-blue {
///                color: blue;
///              }
///
///              &-red {
///                color: red;
///              }
///            }
///          }
