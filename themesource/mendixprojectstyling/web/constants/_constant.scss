/// This is the place where all constants are stored that can be used over
/// multiple files. An example could be a specific width you need to use
/// more than once.
/// It's allowed to store all constants in a single file or split them out.
/// It's recommended to put the type of constants first so it's easier to
/// scan lists of similar constants.

/// @example $width-special: 30.5rem;
///
///          Use in other files as follows:
///          @use "../constants/constants";
///
///          .mps-example {
///            width: constants.$width-special;
///          }
