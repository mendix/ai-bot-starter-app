/// Foundations are styles directly without putting any extra classes on widgets
/// The benefit is that all widgets will automatically behave the same. The
/// drawback is that it becomes more difficult to make adjustments. PDS uses the
/// BEM system to style components in such a way that it's easy to make
/// adjustments allowing for more flexibility.
/// Because you cannot add extra classes on the widget you are often directly
/// competing with Atlas UI CSS. Don't use !important to override other styling,
/// This will cause issues when you want to make changes later.
/// It's allowed to store all foundations in a single file or split them out.
/// It's also important to load the file in _mps.scss after you have created it.
/// When possible use the constants, functions and mixins in PDS. They can be
/// found in `platformdesignsystem/web/[constants/functions/mixins]`

/// @example .mx-progress {
///            width: 100%;
///          }
