/// Only add mixins to this file. Mixins can be called from all other files.
/// A mixin returns SCSS styling so it's mostly used to not repeat yourself.
/// It's allowed to split this file up into multiple mixin files.
/// When possible use the constants, functions and mixins in PDS. They can be
/// found in `platformdesignsystem/web/[constants/functions/mixins]`
/// Ask the PDS team about more info.

/// Example mixin:
/// @mixin example($parameter) {
///   width: $parameter * 2;
/// }

/// Call a mixin as follows in other files:
/// @use "mixins/mixin";
/// .example {
///   mixin.example($parameter);
/// }

/// Mixins go here
